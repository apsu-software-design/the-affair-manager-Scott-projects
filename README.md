# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I created classes based on their attributes (etc. name in Member Class, zipCode in Affair Class). It helped kept the code nice, organized, and readable without having a jungle of code. It's not perfect as some methods have a few lines of code but it was better now then before.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> A lot of came from online like StackOverflow, TypeScript Documentation, some other sites I don't remember. Mainly from those two I mentioned.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 15-20. Could have been much less if I did


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 8 or 9. It was a HUGE struggle trying to get those methods to work. Sometimes the console would throw an error that worked completely, and I have not edited anything. I never got ModifyAffair or getMembers to work. I was really close to figuring out getMembers as it printed "Members participating in this action:", but never printed the members. Now, it just throws the undefined error.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> A lot of problems, but I resolve most except ModifyAffair and getMembers. The arrays were the huge issue. I'm used to arrays in C#, but here I had to change it a little bit to conform TypeScript. I think arrays were the issue for those two methods.
